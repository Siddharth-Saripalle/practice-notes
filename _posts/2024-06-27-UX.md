## What's UX in Code?
### Siddharth Saripalle

User Experience (UX) in coding refers to how easily and effectively users can interact with and understand a program. Good UX ensures that users can achieve their goals with minimal frustration, while poor UX can lead to confusion and errors.

### Key Principles of Good UX in Coding
**Clarity:** Make sure your code is clear and easy to understand. Use meaningful variable names, comments, and structure your code logically.

**Guidance:** Guide users through the process with clear instructions and prompts. This is especially important when your program requires user input.

**Feedback:** Provide immediate and informative feedback. Let users know what the program is doing, what it expects from them, and what the results are.

**Error Handling:** Anticipate potential errors and handle them gracefully. Provide informative error messages that help users understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

**Consistency:** Maintain a consistent style and format throughout your program. Consistent prompts, messages, and outputs make it easier for users to follow along.

### Examples of Good and Bad UX in Coding
**Bad UX Example:**

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num1 = 2, num2 = 3, sum;
    sum = num1 + num2;
    printf("num1 = %d, num2 = %d, sum = %d\n", num1, num2, sum);
    return 0;
}
```
**Why It's Bad:**

-No prompts for user input.
-Output is not clear or informative.
-No feedback provided to the user.

**Improved UX Example**
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num1 = 2, num2 = 3, sum;

    printf("Enter the first number: %d\n", num1);  
    printf("Enter the second number: %d\n", num2);  

    sum = num1 + num2;

    printf("The sum of %d and %d is %d.\n", num1, num2, sum);
    return 0;
}
```
**Why It's Better:**

-Prompts for user input are clear, even though they simulate input in this example.
-Output is contextual and informative.
-Provides feedback at each step.

*By focusing on these principles, you can write code that not only functions well but is also pleasant and easy for users to interact with. This approach enhances the overall user experience and makes your programs more effective and enjoyable to use.*
