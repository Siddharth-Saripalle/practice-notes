## For Loop
### Understand how a for loop works.

**What is a for loop?**
A for loop in C is a control flow statement used to execute a block of code a _specific number of times_. 
It's generally used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.

**Components of the For Loop**
Initialization: Sets the starting value of the loop counter.<br>
Condition: Evaluates before each iteration. If true, the loop continues; if false, the loop stops.<br>
Increment/Decrement: Updates the loop counter after each iteration.<br>

**A Simple For loop code**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // For loop to print the first 5 natural numbers
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
    {
        printf("%d ", i);
    }
    printf("\n"); // Print a newline at the end for better formatting

    return 0;
}
```
**Explanation**

Initialization: int i = 1; sets the loop counter i to 1.<br>
Condition: i <= 5; checks if i is less than or equal to 5.<br>
Increment: i++ increases i by 1 after each iteration.<br>
Loop Body: printf("%d ", i); prints the current value of i.<br>
